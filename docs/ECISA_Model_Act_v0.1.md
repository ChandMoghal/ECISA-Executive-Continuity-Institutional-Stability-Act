# Executive Continuity & Institutional Stability Act (ECISA)

**Model Act v0.1 — Draft for public comment | 2026-01-13**

_Status: Draft. This document is offered for adaptation by legislators, attorneys, and governance engineers. It is not legal advice._


## Section 1. Findings and intent

**1.1 Findings.** Congress finds that:

(a) continuity of essential federal functions is a national security and public welfare requirement;

(b) institutional capacity is a public asset accumulated over decades;

(c) mass termination, indefinite furlough, or disabling reorganization without transparent justification and review can produce systemic failure modes faster than corrective democratic processes can respond; and

(d) guardrails must be capacity-aware and auditable.

**1.2 Intent.** The intent of this Act is to create enforceable continuity floors, transparency duties, and review gates for high-impact executive actions affecting federal staffing and essential functions.


## Section 2. Definitions

For purposes of this Act:

**2.1 “Essential Function”** means a federal function whose loss or severe degradation is reasonably likely to cause material harm to life, safety, constitutional rights, critical infrastructure, financial stability, or the nation’s ability to execute lawful obligations.

**2.2 “Continuity Floor”** means the minimum operational capacity required to sustain an Essential Function at a basic level of service, including staffing, facilities, and authority.

**2.3 “High-Impact Action”** means any Executive action, directive, reorganization, personnel policy, or budget execution step that is reasonably likely to:

(a) reduce an agency’s workforce by ≥ 10% within 120 days; or

(b) eliminate or suspend an Essential Function; or

(c) consolidate or transfer an Essential Function across agencies; or

(d) change civil-service classification rules affecting ≥ 5,000 positions.

**2.4 “Continuity Impact Statement (CIS)”** means the public document required by Section 5.

**2.5 “Covered Personnel”** means career civil servants and other employees whose removal is subject to statutory due process protections, plus contractors performing Essential Functions where specified.


## Section 3. Scope and rule of construction

**3.1 Scope.** This Act applies to High-Impact Actions by the President, Executive Office components, and Executive agencies.

**3.2 Rule of construction.** Nothing in this Act prevents lawful discipline for cause, lawful budget reductions enacted by Congress, or emergency measures meeting Section 8; it limits only abrupt, non-transparent capacity destruction and function-disablement.

**3.3 Severability.** If any provision of this Act is held invalid, the remainder shall remain in effect.


## Section 4. Continuity floors for essential functions

**4.1 Essential Function Register.** Within 180 days of enactment, each agency shall publish an Essential Function Register (EFR) listing Essential Functions, baseline capacity metrics, and Continuity Floors.

**4.2 Minimum continuity.** No High-Impact Action may reduce an Essential Function below its Continuity Floor unless Section 8 (Emergency Derogation) is invoked and complied with.

**4.3 Capacity metrics.** Each agency shall maintain simple capacity metrics for Essential Functions, including at minimum:

(a) core staffing FTE;

(b) backlog and/or throughput;

(c) incident response time; and

(d) service uptime where applicable.


## Section 5. Continuity Impact Statement (CIS) and publication duties

**5.1 CIS required.** Prior to any High-Impact Action, the initiating authority shall publish a CIS not fewer than 30 days before the action takes effect, except as allowed by Section 8.

**5.2 CIS contents.** The CIS shall include:

(a) action description and legal authority claimed, including statutes, orders, appropriations, and relevant OMB guidance;

(b) affected agencies, offices, programs, and Essential Functions;

(c) projected capacity deltas, including FTE changes, contractor changes, facility changes, and expected service impacts;

(d) risk analysis, including plausible failure modes, second-order impacts, and a mitigation plan;

(e) alternatives considered, including the least-disruptive alternative that achieves stated objectives; and

(f) implementation plan and timeline, including phased gates and rollback triggers.

**5.3 Signatures.** The CIS shall be signed, at a minimum, by:

(a) the agency head or duly authorized delegate;

(b) the Chief Financial Officer (CFO);

(c) the Chief Information Officer (CIO), where IT-dependent services are affected;

(d) the Inspector General, acknowledging receipt; and

(e) a designated “Continuity Officer.”

**5.4 Public artifacts.** CIS documents, EFRs, and associated metrics shall be published in a public, machine-readable repository with stable identifiers and tamper-evident hashes. Implementation details are technology-neutral.


## Section 6. Personnel integrity and non-bypass rule

**6.1 No mass bypass.** Covered Personnel protections shall not be bypassed via reclassification, mass reassignment, coerced resignations, or restructuring designed primarily to evade due process.

**6.2 Adverse action aggregation.** If multiple agencies execute coordinated reductions within 120 days that jointly exceed thresholds in Section 2, such reductions shall be treated as a single High-Impact Action for purposes of this Act.

**6.3 Protected operational spine.** Agencies shall designate “Continuity Spine Roles” required to maintain Essential Functions; elimination or reassignment of these roles triggers CIS and Section 7 review.


## Section 7. Independent review gate and rapid audit

**7.1 Review gate.** A High-Impact Action may not take effect until the oversight offices below certify receipt and completeness of the CIS and publish a Review Note:

(a) the agency Inspector General (IG), for completeness and integrity check;

(b) the Government Accountability Office (GAO), or equivalent congressional audit office, for risk framing and capacity impact plausibility; and

(c) the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), or civil service authority, for classification and due-process compliance.

**7.2 Review Note scope.** Oversight bodies do not approve policy; they certify that the claimed authority, projected impacts, and mitigation plan are stated, auditable, and not obviously evasive.

**7.3 Timeline.** Review Notes shall be issued within 21 days of CIS publication. If no Review Note is issued within 21 days, the High-Impact Action is automatically stayed until a Review Note is published or a court orders otherwise.


## Section 8. Emergency derogation

**8.1 Emergency condition.** Emergency derogation is permitted only where delay is reasonably likely to cause imminent harm to life or safety, or irreparable critical infrastructure failure.

**8.2 Emergency CIS.** Even in emergency, a short-form CIS must be published within 72 hours of initiation, including:

(a) the emergency basis;

(b) the scope and duration of the derogation; and

(c) rollback conditions.

**8.3 Sunset.** Emergency derogations expire after 30 days unless renewed with a full CIS and Section 7 review.


## Section 9. Enforcement and judicial review

**9.1 Standing.** Any affected employee union or association, state attorney general, or materially affected regulated party shall have standing to seek injunctive relief for violations of this Act.

**9.2 Expedited review.** Courts shall provide expedited consideration. Filing of an action under this section shall trigger an automatic temporary stay of the High-Impact Action until a preliminary hearing, unless the government meets a clear-and-convincing emergency showing under Section 8.

**9.3 Remedies.** Remedies may include injunction, restoration of unlawfully removed capacity, and mandatory publication of withheld artifacts.

**9.4 Anti-retaliation.** Retaliation against whistleblowers or staff who disclose noncompliance artifacts is prohibited and subject to penalties under existing law, plus civil damages.


## Section 10. Implementation checklist (non-normative)

This section is non-normative and provided for implementation guidance only.

(a) Publish Essential Function Register and Continuity Floors.

(b) Assign a Continuity Officer and identify Continuity Spine Roles.

(c) Stand up a public, machine-readable artifact repository for CIS, EFR, and metrics.

(d) Define capacity metrics per Essential Function (minimum set) and update them monthly.

(e) Establish a 21-day Review Note pipeline (IG, GAO, OPM) with public timestamps.

(f) Create an Emergency CIS template (72-hour publication) and sunset controls.

(g) Adopt internal rollback triggers for failed mitigation.


## Appendix A. Non-normative alignment note (optional)

This Appendix is informational only and does not alter the statutory meaning of this Act.

This Act is compatible with evidence-first governance stacks that emphasize disclosure, auditability, capacity-aware constraints, and continuity of essential functions.
