ECISA (Executive Continuity \& Institutional Stability Act) — Human-Speak Companion for Legislators and Staff

Companion explainer v1.0 (non-normative)
This brief does not change the legal meaning of the Model Act; it explains it in plain language for non-lawyers.


Purpose: translate the Model Act + templates into plain, audit-ready language for policymakers, counsel, and oversight staff.



1\) Why this exists (the failure mode ECISA targets)

ECISA is written for one specific national risk: rapid, high-impact executive actions that destroy institutional capacity faster than Congress, courts, or elections can correct the damage—especially when that capacity loss disables “essential functions” people rely on (safety, rights, infrastructure, benefits, stability). faa81c7f-f1ba-484f-92b0-48505b9…

This is not an “anti-reform” law. It does not stop lawful discipline for cause, lawful budget cuts enacted by Congress, or legitimate reorganizations. It stops abrupt, non-transparent capacity destruction from happening in the dark. faa81c7f-f1ba-484f-92b0-48505b9…



2\) The core rule in one sentence

If an executive action is big enough to disable essential functions or wipe out operational capacity, the government must (1) publish impacts in a standard format, (2) prove it won’t drop essential functions below continuity minimums, and (3) pass a short independent completeness review before it takes effect. faa81c7f-f1ba-484f-92b0-48505b9…



3\) What “continuity” means in existing federal doctrine

Federal continuity policy already assumes government must keep Essential Functions running through disruption (including continuity of “National Essential Functions”). This is not a new concept ECISA invents; ECISA makes it enforceable and auditable for high-impact executive actions.



4\) Key ECISA terms in plain English

Essential Function

A government function whose loss or serious degradation is likely to cause material harm—to life, safety, constitutional rights, critical infrastructure, financial stability, or lawful obligations. faa81c7f-f1ba-484f-92b0-48505b9…

Continuity Floor

The minimum operational capacity required to keep an Essential Function alive at a basic service level (staffing, facilities, authority). faa81c7f-f1ba-484f-92b0-48505b9…

High-Impact Action

An executive action (directive, reorg, personnel policy, budget execution step) likely to:





cut an agency workforce by 10%+ within 120 days, or





eliminate/suspend an Essential Function, or





transfer/consolidate an Essential Function across agencies, or





change civil-service classification rules affecting 5,000+ positions. faa81c7f-f1ba-484f-92b0-48505b9…





CIS (Continuity Impact Statement)

A required public filing that explains what’s being done, under what legal authority, what functions are affected, how capacity changes, what risks follow, and what mitigation/rollback plan exists.



5\) The “three documents” ECISA forces into daylight

A) Essential Function Register (EFR) — “What must not go dark”

Each agency must publish an EFR listing its Essential Functions, baseline capacity metrics, and Continuity Floors.

This is the government’s public declaration of:





Which functions are load-bearing, and





What minimum capacity keeps them viable.





B) Continuity Impact Statement (CIS) — “What this action will break (or won’t)”

Before a High-Impact Action takes effect, the initiating authority must publish a CIS at least 30 days in advance (unless a narrow emergency exception applies).

The CIS must include: claimed legal authority, affected functions, projected capacity deltas, risk/failure modes, mitigation, least-disruptive alternative considered, implementation timeline, and rollback triggers.

C) Review Notes — “Independent completeness check”

ECISA creates a fast review gate:





Inspector General (IG) checks completeness/integrity;





GAO (or equivalent congressional audit office) checks plausibility of capacity impact framing;





(OPM portal for civil-service protections)
OPM (or civil service authority) checks classification and due-process compliance. faa81c7f-f1ba-484f-92b0-48505b9…




(nonpartisan CRS brief)

This review does not approve the policy. It certifies the filing is auditable and not evasive. faa81c7f-f1ba-484f-92b0-48505b9…

Hard stop rule: If the Review Note isn’t issued in 21 days, the action is automatically stayed until a Review Note exists (or a court orders otherwise). faa81c7f-f1ba-484f-92b0-48505b9…



6\) What ECISA blocks (without blocking lawful governance)

ECISA blocks “go-fast capacity destruction” tactics such as:





mass terminations framed as “reorganization” with no public impact accounting,





reclassification or mass reassignment designed to evade due process (“non-bypass rule”),





coordinated multi-agency cuts timed to avoid thresholds (ECISA aggregates them), and





eliminating load-bearing roles (Continuity Spine Roles) without triggering review. faa81c7f-f1ba-484f-92b0-48505b9…





This aligns with the broader federal merit-system concept: the civil service has protected rules and prohibitions around certain personnel actions, including prohibited personnel practices and due-process expectations.



7\) Emergency powers exist, but they expire (and must still be documented)

ECISA allows emergency derogation only when delay would likely cause imminent harm to life/safety or irreparable critical infrastructure failure. faa81c7f-f1ba-484f-92b0-48505b9…

Even then:





a short-form CIS must be published within 72 hours, and





emergency derogations sunset after 30 days unless renewed with a full CIS + review. faa81c7f-f1ba-484f-92b0-48505b9…







8\) Enforcement: how ECISA becomes real (not aspirational)

ECISA creates:





standing for affected unions/associations, state attorneys general, or materially affected parties to seek injunctive relief,





expedited review, and





an automatic temporary stay upon filing (unless the government meets a clear emergency showing). faa81c7f-f1ba-484f-92b0-48505b9…





It also prohibits retaliation against whistleblowers or staff who disclose noncompliance artifacts. faa81c7f-f1ba-484f-92b0-48505b9…

(That complements the existing IG framework—IGs are built to conduct audits/investigations and report problems independently.)



9\) How a Hill office would use ECISA in oversight (practical workflow)

If ECISA is law, staff don’t have to argue about motives. They can ask for the required artifacts:





EFR: Which Essential Functions are implicated? What are the Continuity Floors? ECISA\_EFR\_Template\_v1.0





CIS: What authority is claimed? What functions are affected? What capacity deltas and service impacts are projected? What rollback triggers exist? ECISA\_CIS\_Template\_v1.0





Review Notes: Did IG/GAO/OPM certify completeness? If not, why not? faa81c7f-f1ba-484f-92b0-48505b9…





Metrics: Did the action push any function below its Floor? If yes, did emergency derogation apply—and did it sunset properly?





This turns oversight from “narrative warfare” into document-driven governance.

Closing (why this is drafted “this way”)

ECISA’s posture is simple: major executive capacity changes must be explainable in public, in advance, with measurable impacts, and with independent completeness checks. That design doesn’t weaken the Presidency—it strengthens the Republic by making “capacity destruction” expensive in daylight. faa81c7f-f1ba-484f-92b0-48505b9…
